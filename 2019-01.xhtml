<h1>January</h1>
    
<h2 id="uxX57XaqOLMQjM7NqbxvKB3">Monday, January 1</h2>

<p>I rose early this morning and worked on cleaning up my late 2018 work journal, working for an hour on this.</p>  

<h2 id="ungAhwzfBlDJCBMoGi9PMOH">Wednesday, January 3</h2>

<p>We stopped by work this afternoon so that I could pick up my most recent SF50 and other documentation requisite for my unemployment application.  I had received a box containing 199 Archaeognatha specimens in 88 vials.</p>

<p>I worked on adding images and scripts to my 2018 work journal, trying to finalize it.</p>

<p>John asked me to post the recent <i>Refuge Notebook</i> articles from December, so I formatted and posted these. I also made posts to Biology News.</p>

<p>Debbie helped me make travel arrangements for Fairbanks, so this is a go.  Now I need to figure out my talk since I was not able to work on the alpine defoliation project in January as I had intended.</p> 

<p>Liz Graham wrote, asking that I fill in the STDP report review.  I started looking through that dataset for notable records. <i>Pissodes fiskei</i> is not in our Alaska checklist.  I checked that sequence again.  It is closest to a sequence of <i>Pissodes costatus</i>, which we have in Alaska. There were no other new records.  I need to get this into a publication of some sort.  I also need to start an Alaska library on github.</p>

<p>I worked on re-submitting AWCC/Caribou Hills data for the ITSx step (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_1">script</a>).</p>

<p>Examining specimen with barcode label UAM100185885 (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11301">KNWR:Ento:11301</a>), from Bay View Cemetery. This is female Petrobiinae, with sole shaped lateral ocelli. There appear to be 2+2 eversible vesicles on segment VI, but it is a little hard to tell because only the outer pair are ever eversed. This looks like <i>Pedetontus</i> s. str.</p>

<p>I sorted the remaining 67 or so vials of bristletail specimens given to me by Rod Crawford, not opening the vials, but just roughly sorting them based on what they appeared to be.  There appear to be less than 88 vials listed on the loan, but this is ok.  I was hoping to see some <i>Petridiobius</i> specimens, but there were none.  There was more <i>Pedetontus</i> s. str. than anything, followed by <i>Pedetontus</i> cf. <i>submutans</i> and <i>Machilinus</i>.  Most of these specimens had been sifted from moss or litter.</p>

<p>I finished adding material to my late 2018 work journal including scans, references, etc.</p>

<p>Needing to figure out what to present on next week at the AKES meeting, I resumed the <i>AKES Newsletter</i> article on soil fungi affected by earthworms at Stormy Lake with the intention of adding affects to soil fungi to the earthworm presentation I gave in the fall.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_2">R script</a>.</p>

<p>I paid the Arctos invoices.</p>

<p>I helped Todd with tagging eight sea otters pelts.</p>

<p>Before the winter is over I want to ski down to the trail intersection near Slikok Lake where I collected specimen <a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_RecordView?processid=MOBIL6660-18">MOBIL6660-18</a> last year.  This was a Diptera larva collected from a spring in winter.  There is no close match for the COI sequence obtained from this specimen on BOLD; the closest match is 89.92% similarity and is identified as Diptera. Other matches over 89% are Chironomidae.  I would like to collect more specimens to try to put a genus name on these using morphology.</p>

<p>Chironomid larva specimen <a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_RecordView?processid=MOBIL6660-18">MOBIL6660-18</a>.</p></div>    

<p>I requested that records from dataset DS-BOWSER be included the next time that the BOLD BIN algorithm (Ratnasingham et al., <a href="references.xhtml#Ratnasinghametal2013">2013</a>) is run.  This has not been done for some time. For example, the chironomid specimen referred to above collected in March 2018 has not yet been assigned to a BIN despite having a clean, full-length sequence.</p>

<p>I did look at results of the PIPITS analysis of 2017 Stormy Lake fungal data (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_3">script</a>).</p>

<p>I also skied down the spring where I had collected that mystery chironomid before and collected more sediment, both from the spring and from the stream where it crosses the snowmachine trail.</p>
