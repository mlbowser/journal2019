<h1>October</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">Tuesday, October 1</h2>

<p>I came to work late today after having new winter tires put on our minivan this morning.</p>

<div class="nb"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-10-01_nb01.jpg"/></div>                

<p>I made preparations to ship out these 11 individuals to the American Museum of Natural History tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Wednesday, October 2</h2>

<div class="nb"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-10-02_nb02.jpg"/></div>   

<p>I found more patches of vetch.  When I returned to the office I sent out the email below.</p>

<blockquote>John, Colin, and Todd,

I did pull vetch today, but I also walked up and down the road in both directions, finding more and larger patches of vetch up to about 8 m across.  These were reproducing and getting into the woods.  I concentrated my effort on removing stems that had seed pods to try to reduce reproduction.  Pulling these was not practical because the senescing stems broke off of the roots easily and the soil there was compacted and contained much gravel.  One of the groups of plants is quite close to a little stream, possibly limiting herbicide options.

See a map and photos of these four known patches of vetch near Russian River at the URI below.

I am planning on taking off tomorrow through next week[...]  I am willing to apply herbicide, but I have done none of this since last season, so I need to know where things are, what herbicide to use, etc.  If there is good weather next week, then I may be able to go out one day to spray this if this would make sense so late in the season.

Sincerely,

Matt</blockquote>

<p>John asked me to compile updated <i>Refuge Notebook</i> data.</p>

<p>I made some updates to the Kenai NWR species list and got this sent out to Kristine Sowl.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Kristine,

Attached is a current list and the change log.  I have slowed down on adding species while we continue to move functionality over to FWSpecies.  This is why I have not been producing updated checklists lately.  I intend to get this working better this winter.

Sincerely,

Matt</blockquote>

<p>I ended up needing to leave early.</p>

<p>I drove water samples from the North South Lakes to FedEx Kenai to be shipped out to SePRO SRTC (Fedex tracking #: 813677694320).</p>

<p>I finished entering data on recent <i>Petridiobius</i> specimens (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11338">KNWR:Ento:11338</a> and <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11339">KNWR:Ento:11339</a>) and sent these data to John Gatesy.</p>

<blockquote>John,

Collection data are attached.  I entered data for these specimens into Arctos, the collection management system we use.  All media and data are in the public domain.  The specimen records will also appear in GBIF after a while.

<p>I took a walk to Nordic Lake.  Both Headquarters Lake and Nordic Lake are now rimmed with thin ice.</p>

<p>I posted Biology News entries.</p>

<!-- 06:15-07:00 -->

<p>I worked some on going through the list of apparent new records from the Slikok project, finishing at <i>Hilara argentata</i>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Monday, October 21</h2>

<p>I took the telework recertification training.</p>

<p>I checked Slikok project apparent new Alaska records of <i>Hydrotaea unispinosa</i>, <i>Idiocerus elegans</i>, <i>Idiocerus subnitens</i>, <i>Illinoia menziesiae</i>, and <i>Lachesilla contraforcepeta</i>.</p>


<p>I updated the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/bibliography.html">Kenai bio literature bibliography</a> with what I had.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I collected a few specimens for the Continental Mycoblitz, but I failed to find the few species I was after.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Tuesday, October 22</h2>

<p>I worked on composing my <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article on <i>Operophtera bruceata</i>.</p>

<p>I just found out that <i>Operophtera</i> specimens from Alaska formerly identified as <i>Operophtera bruceata</i> are now <i>Operophtera occidentalis</i>.  See discussion at <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/18618236">https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/18618236</a>.  BOLD specimen  <a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_RecordView?processid=GNAU149-10">GNAU149-10</a> from Sunrise is currently identified on BOLD as <i>Operophtera bruceata</i> in BIN <a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAA2999">BOLD:AAA2999</a>.  BOLD specimen <a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_RecordView?processid=GNAU152-10">GNAU152-10</a>, also from Sunrise, is identified as <i>Operophtera occidentalis</i> and was placed in BIN <a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAA3000">BOLD:AAA3000</a>.  All four Alaskan specimens of <i>Operophtera</i> from Alaska are from Sunrise. Of these, two are <i>O. bruceata</i> and two are <i>O. occidentalis</i>, so both are present on the Kenai Peninsula.</p>

<p>I found that Pohl et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Pohletal2018">2018</a>) rasied <i>O. bruceata occidentalis</i> back up to a full species based on the data from Gwiazdowski et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Gwiazdowskietal2013">2013</a>).  The best key separating these appears to be Troubridge and Fitzpatrick (<a href="references.xhtml#TroubridgeFitzpatrick1993">1993</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 <li>Abdomen brown to golden-brown. Two color forms: dark form with forewing dorsal surface lines faint but recognizable; light form with forewing dorsal surface lines distinct and dark, almost fused to form dark bands; light bands within cell M3 darker than other cells. Distributed west of the Cascade Mts and Coast Mts . . . <i>O. bruceata occidentalis</i></li>

<li>Abdomen brown. Costa of forewing ventral surface brown. Wing colour grey west and brown east of Rocky Mts. Forewing dorsal surface lines distinct but pale, not fused to form dark bands; light bands within cell M3 no darker than within other cells. Occurs east of the Cascade and Coast Mts . . . <i>O. bruceata bruceata</i>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I photographed and collected one specimen on the side of the headquarters building that looks to me more like <i>O. occidentalis</i> than <i>O. bruceata</i> (iNaturalist: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/34758287">34758287</a>). I took the left midleg to be sequenced via LifeScanner (vial BOLD-CU4) and pinned and spread the specimen (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11340">KNWR:Ento:11340</a>).</p>

<p>Todd photographed an individual from Headquarters that really looks like good <i>O. occidentalis</i> (iNaturalist: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/34757881">34757881</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Wednesday, October 23</h2>

<p>I finsihed my <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article on winter moths.</p>

<p>I packaged worm specimens to go out to Kyungsoo and Tyler tomorrow (FedEx tracking #: 813677694282).</p>

<p>I listened in on the Board of Fish meeting some while doing other things.</p>

<p>I collected an <i>Operophtera</i> which I am pretty sure is the dark phase of <i>Operophtera occidentalis</i> (iNatualist: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/34808119">34808119</a>; <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11341">KNWR:Ento:11341</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">Thursday, October 24</h2>

<p>I prepared a list of external references for FWSpecies (<a href="appendices_October-December.xhtml#whatisgoingonhere">R script</a>).</p>

<blockquote>Dear Jaclyn,

Attached is an initial upload of 10550 external links for the Kenai checklist in FWSpecies formatted as in the template you provided.

Sincerely,

<p>While I was working on this I listened in on the Board of Fish meeting.  My Agenda Change Request passed and will be included in the March 2020 meeting.</p>

<p>John asked for my accomplishments for the fiscal year, which I summarized in an e-mail.</p>

<blockquote>FY2019 accomplishments

Initial processing of AWCC/Caribou Hills arthropod and fungal data.  Reprocessed Slikok arthropod NGS data for publication.  Worked on Forest service NGS dataset and manuscript (close to submitting this one).
Routine posting of Biology News, Refuge Notebook, and other website updates.
Researched origin, distribution, and diet of Alaska blackfish in Kenai.
Participated in efforts to eradicate elodea from the Kenai Peninsula.
Worked with migration of Kenai National Wildlife Refuge checklist to FWSpecies.
Sampled LTEMP/Slikok black spruce sites.
Researched potential vermicides for eradicating exotic earthworms.  Identified a second native lumbricid earthworm species (Bimastos parvus) from Alaska based on specimens from UAM (not yet published other than specimen records on Arctos). Collaborated with earthworm researchers Adrian Wackett and Tyler Baumann to learn more about distribution and effects of introduced earthworms in Alaska. Submitted proposal to Alaska Board of Fish to ban the use of Lumbricus earthworms as fishing bait in Alaska (ACR accepted in October 2019, on the schedule for consideration in March 2020).
