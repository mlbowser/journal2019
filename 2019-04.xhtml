<h1>April</h1>    

<h2 id="toc_1">Monday, April 1</h2>

<div class="todo">To do:
<ul>
<li>STDP analysis.</li>

</div>                                                                                                                              

<p>I did some work on the STDP analysis, filtering records and generating a better phylogenetic tree.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_69">R script and I/O</a>.</p>

<p>I made a requested update to Biology News.</p> 

<p>I formatted and posted last week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>                                  

<h2 id="toc_2">Tuesday, April 2</h2>

<p>I remotely attended day of the USGS High Performance Computing in R and Python class.</p>

<p>Over lunch I checked the pan traps that I had left out.  They caught nothing but flies that look like mostly Drosophilidae and Muscidae.  I dumped these out.</p>

<p>During breaks in the class I worked on the STDP manuscript.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Wednesday, April 3</h2>

<p>I continued with the HPC class.  Today was my first real introduction to python code.</p>

<p>John informed me that we will be doing some LTEMP style work this summer.  More to come on this.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Thursday, April 4</h2>

<p>I remotely attended the last day of the hpc class.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Friday, April 5</h2>

<p>I worked on cleaning up the STDP HTS data in preparation for merging the morphology-based and molecular ID datasets (<a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_70">R script</a>).  I also started scrutinizing unidentified sequences and running these individually on BOLD and Blastn.  BOLD was down for a while, though.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy find was an apparently solid identification of <i>Placusa incompleta</i> (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), a Palearctic species adventive in North America and now present on both coasts from Washington and British Columbia to Quebec.  This looks like a new record for AK.  We picked it up in Anchorage in a trap where bycatch had not been removed.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Saturday-Sunday, April 6-7</h2>

<p>I put in 1 1/2 hours finishing up curating the STDP HTS identifications, checking unassigned sequences against BOLD and NCBI Blastn.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Monday, April 8</h2>

<p>Examining series of stoneflies <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11319">KNWR:Ento:11319</a> from Soldotna Creek Park.  These are <i>Utacapnia columbiana</i>.  The immatures also agree with <i>Utacapnia</i>, but these apparently cannot be identified to species or even to genera with certainty.  One immature specimen I photographed and put into LifeScanner vial BOLD-GO8 (→ <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11320">KNWR:Ento:11320</a>).</p>

<p>I finished a draft <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I learned from Hobby (<a href="references.xhtml#Hobby2018">2018</a>) that hooligan (<i>Thaleichthys pacificus</i>) do ascend the Kasilof River.  I entered data from this report into Arctos (see <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenResults.cfm?accn_trans_id=21121750">these records</a>.)</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>I examined specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Ento:377284">UAM:Ento:377284</a>, which contains both <i>Eisenia fetida</i> and <i>Bimastos rubidus</i>.  I took a tissue sample from the tail end of a large <i>Eisenia</i> and placed it in Lifescanner vial BOLD-MZ2.  I could not perceive any banding on this specimen, making it likely that it is <i>Eisenia andrei</i>.</p>

<p>I packaged UAM worm specimens to be shipped back to UAM along with six KNWR:Ento vials donated to UAM (loan KNWR-2019.01-UAM-Ento). FedEx tracking number: 813677694823.</p>

<p>I went on a short walk in the afternoon.  Headquarters Lake has almost completely opened up.  Last week there was rotten but thick ice over the lake.  Today only a small rim of ice remained along the southwest shore of the lake; the rest appeared to be free.  It made me want to go canoeing.</p>

<p>I worked on adding more methods and methods citations to the STDP manuscript.</p>
