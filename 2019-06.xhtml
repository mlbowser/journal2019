<p>Rachel, Frannie, and I did the 50 point rake survey for elodea on Daniels Lake.  We found no elodea.</p>

<p>I received a set of birch specimens loaned to Hugh McAllister.  I examined these and compared them with the notes he took on the specimens and the provisional key that he wrote.  I spent a good part of the day examining specimens.  I learned that, in counting the major veins, the smaller secondary veins toward the apex of the leaf are not counted.  I also learned to recognize the basal leaves on the stems, which are most useful for diagnosis.  The hair on petioles that Hugh refers to is not the hair on the adaxial surface of the petiole.  All of the birches I have been examining have fine hair here.  There are often hairs on the abaxial surface of petioles and on the young stems on <i>Betula kenaica</i>; these are absent in <i>Betula pendula</i>.  I was not able to see useful characters in the catkin scales in the specimens I examined.  None of the female catkin scales that I examined had reflexed lateral lobes in <i>B. pendula</i> or <i>B. kenaica</i>.  I started entering Hugh's identifications and notes into the corresponding records on Arctos.</p>

<p>Today I obtained permission from Colton Lipka to begin sampling for blackfish.  He requested that I cull all blackfish that I do capture.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Wednesday, June 5</h2>

<p>John wanted to finalize our LTEMP sampling plans today.  I spent most of the day producing maps and summaries helpful for making decisions about the project.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_3">R script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Thursday, June 6</h2>
<p>I worked on assembling data from the Slikok grid for the purpose of LTEMP planning.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_4">R script</a>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon on the way home I poked around in one drainage in Kenai looking for Alaska blackfish. I walked up most of the stream behind Walmart from the downstream side of the culvert under the Kenai Spur Highway up to about 60.56479N, 151.22138W.  I saw no evidence of blackfish in this segment.</p>

<p>I also stopped by the downstream side of the stream where it passes under Lawton Drive.  The culvert system under Lawton Drive may be a barrier to fish passage.  Most of the water passes under the road somewhere underground.  The aboveground culvert was nearly dry and was suspended some distance above the current stream.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Friday, June 7</h2>

<p>John asked me to calculate CV and similarity indices for the LTEMP and Slikok black spruce sites.  I did so.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_5">R script</a>.</p>

<p>I worked some on improving the STDP EDRR manuscript.</p>


<h2 id="toc_7">Monday, June 10</h2>
<p>John asked me to make a revised map for this summer's helicopter work.  See map below and <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_6">R script</a>.</p>

<p>I worked a little on the STDP manuscript.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Tuesday, June 11</h2>
<p>In response to a call about a loon with fishing line on it, Cullen and I took a canoe and landing net down to Johnson Lake.  We found and pursued the entangled loon, but we failed to catch it. Despite the fishing line on its bill and left side, it still dove and swam well, easily avoiding us.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I worked on the STDP manuscript.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_7">R script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Wednesday, June 12</h2>
<p>I worked on the STDP manuscript in the morning.</p>
<p>Steve asked me to post an emergency closure order related to the Swan Lake Fire on the refuge's website, so I did so.</p>
<p>Mark and I canoed across Headquarters Lake looking for a runaway drone that had flown off yesterday afternoon.  We did not find it.</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">Thursday, June 13</h2>

<p>I worked on the EDRR manuscript, posting raw FASTQ files from this project on zenodo at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245461">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245461</a>.</p>

<p>We received a call reporting that the loon on Johnson Lake now has a piece of wood attached to it by fishing line, so I grabbed a solo canoe and Todd's truck and drove down there.  I was able to capture the loon, cut the fishing line from it, and release it.  It and another loon had been out in the lake with a couple of tiny chicks.  I was only able to capture the loon because it stayed with the chicks, allowing me to get close. The one loon had apparently swallowed a lure or hook, which I could not see or pull out, so I just cut the fishing line at the bird's bill.  The loon was robust, lively, and apparently healthy when released.</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">Friday, June 14</h2>
<p>I worked on the STDP manuscript including updating one of the figures (<a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_8">R script</a>)</p>

<p>Mark, Dom, and I tried out the new drone sub that Mark recently acquired.</p>

<p>I completed the 2019 IMT Awareness Training.</p>

<p>I started transferring Slikok FASTQ files to Yeti for analysis.</p>

<p>In the afternoon John, Rachel, Cullen, and I visited test polygons for the landcover classification error estimation project to learn the proper methods.</p>

<h2 id="toc_13">Tuesday, June 18</h2>

<p>I mostly worked on the Slikok arthropod data.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_10">i/o</a> and SLURM scripts <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_11">1</a>-<a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_13">3</a>.</p>

<div class="nb"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-06-18_nb.jpg"/></div>

<h2 id="toc_14">Wednesday, June 19</h2>

<p>I continued work on the Slikok arthropod data using the SCVUC pipeline.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_14">i/o</a> and SLURM scripts <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_15">1</a>-<a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_17">3</a>.</p>

<p>While waiting for some of those steps to complete I compared the cleared genitalia of the anthomyiid I collected the other day (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11328">KNWR:Ento:11328</a>) with illustrations and text of Griffiths (<a href="references.xhtml#Griffiths1998">1998</a>).  It is <i>Zaphne borealis</i>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I walked down to the floatplane dock, where I collected a fly (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11329">KNWR:Ento:11329</a>) that I later identified as <i>Hydromyza confluens</i>.</p>

<div class="nb"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-06-19_nb.jpg"/></div>

<h2 id="toc_15">Thursday, June 20</h2>
<p>I worked on the Slikok NGS arthropod dataset, mostly working on taxonomic assignment and filtering.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_18">i/o</a> and example <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_19">SLURM</a> and <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_21">R</a> scripts.</p>

<p>I was in the office for a about a half hour, but I was called home due to sick kids.</p>

<p>I sent an inquiry regarding sequencing of Kenai birches to McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre.</p>

<p>Rachel and I drove out to Marathon Road, where we walked east through the wetland to the headwaters of the stream that flows into the pond off of Candlelight Drive.  We were looking for blackfish in any water bodies out there, seeking to determine the upper limit of this species' distribution in this little watershed.  We found no blackfish.</p>

<p>We also completed three of the landcover classification error estimation polygon plots while we were out there.</p>

<p>We collected one blackfish off of Candlelight drive on the upstream side of the culvert that runs under the Kenai Spur Highway.</p>

<p>We looked into the same stream where it flows under Bridge Access.  We saw salmonids and sticklebacks, but no blackfish.  This does not look like good blackfish habitat.</p>

<p>The wetlands were extremely dry today.</p>
