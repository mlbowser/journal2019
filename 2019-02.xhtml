<p>I looked through the sediment sample from the stream collected yesterday.  There were many ostracods, a few tiny worms, two caddisfly larvae, and three Diptera larvae, each different from the other.</p>

<p>I posted this week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article, starting a new volume for the year.</p>

<p>I updated the KNWR Biology's <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/bibliography.html">publications bibliography</a> and posted new literature announcements to <a href="http://www.akentsoc.org/">http://www.akentsoc.org/</a>.</p>

<p>I resumed work on the Stormy Lake fungal data (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_4">script</a>).</p>

<p>I am excited to have just learned about FUNGuild (Nguyen et al., <a href="references.xhtml#Nguyenetal2016">2016</a>).  After some formatting fixes (removing spaces, etc.) I was able to submit my OTU table to FUNGuild at <a href="http://www.stbates.org/guilds/app.php">http://www.stbates.org/guilds/app.php</a>.</p>

<pre>Guilds v1.0 Beta report: 
- 386 assignments were made on OTUs within the input file! 
- Total calculating time = 8.8 seconds!</pre>  

<p>I looked through these results in R (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_5">script</a>).</p> 

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-02-01-1438_site_guilds.png"/>

<p>Comparison of relative abundances of guilds of fungi based on reads summed over infested and not infested sites.</p></div>                       

<p>There were clearly proportionately more mycorrhizal fungi in <i>Lumbricus</i>-free plots than plots in the infestation.</p>

<div class="todo">To do:
<ul>
<li class="done">Get going on AKES presentation.</li>
<li>Arrange for return shipping of <i>Betula</i> specimens.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>I started work on revising my worm presentation.  I am trying to determine which <i>Eisenia</i> species are present.</p> 
 
<p>Specimen/lot <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Ento:378050">UAM:Ento:378050</a> is now identified as "<i>Eisenia andrei</i> and <i>Amynthas</i>," identified by Adrian Wackett by morphology.</p>                               

<p>The specimen I collected from my compost pile recently (<a href="http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_RecordView?processid=MOBIL8994-18">MOBIL8994-18</a>, now also <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:35">KNWR:Inv:35</a>) was identified inconclusively as just <i>Eisenia</i> by BOLD's ID Engine.  I read in Römbke et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Rombkeetal2016">2016</a>) that these two species are separable DNA barcodes.  I submitted the sequence from this specimen to NCBI BLAST and looked at only results that were in the Appendix of  Römbke et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Rombkeetal2016">2016</a>).  This placed my specimen in the <i>Eisenia andrei</i> clade.</p>

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-02-04_KNWR-Inv-35_habitus_live.jpg"/>
<p><i>Eisenia andrei</i> specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:35">KNWR:Inv:35</a>, live, 25.Nov.2018.</p></div>

<p>I also updated the identification of specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:6756">KNWR:Ento:6756</a> to <i>E. andrei</i> because the worms in my compost pile had come from the population at my parents' house.  I later made this new identification unaccepted because vermicomposting cultures may contain both species (Domínguez, <a href="references.xhtml#Dominuez2018">2018</a>).  I need to look for <i>E. fetida</i> in these populations.</p>

<p>I worked on revising my worm presentation on worms I gave in November, updating it with new information and modifying for the upcoming AKES meeting.</p>

<p>I skied east across Headquarters Lake, the small lake to the east, and onto the PSDRA trail system.  These trails had not been groomed.  Upon a little searching on the internet, it looks like this organization is no longer active.  Its website is gone and I saw no activities cited past 2014.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Wednesday, February 6</h2>

<div class="todo">To do:
<ul>
<li>Finish AKES presentation.</li>
<li>Finish travel-related arrangements.</li>
<li>Get specimens together to take to Fairbanks.</li>

</div>

<p>My SLURM job on Yeti was canceled, again after six days.  I do not know why.  I will have to look into this later.  I need to get my presentation done today.</p>

<p>In looking through literature for my talk, I learned that there is another invasive species very similar to <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> that I need to watch out for, <i>Lumbricus friendi</i> (see Csuzdi and Szlávecz, <a href="references.xhtml#CsuzdiSzlavecz2003">2003</a>).</p>

<p>I attended the all employee meeting with the regional director and deputy directory in the middle of the day.</p>                                                                                             
                                                                                    <p>I worked on my AKES presentation on worms.</p>                                                                                    
                                                                                    <p>Looking up more about <i>Lumbricus friendi</i>. This species is not included in the key of Gates and Reynolds (<a href="references.xhtml#GatesReynolds2017">2017</a>).  There are currently only two COI sequences from this species in BOLD, both of them from Europe.</p>                                                                                    
                                                                                    <p>I examined specimens <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:8612">KNWR:Ento:8612</a> and <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7096">KNWR:Ento:7096</a>.  Both appear to have canoe-shaped tubercula pubertatis, so they appear to be <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>.</p>

After Derek brought me to the museum I walked around the museum vicinity looking for willow rosette galls, but I found none.  I noted that the birches (<i>Betula neoalaskana</i>) still retained much if not most of their seeds and these had been falling very recently on top of the snow.</p>

<p>I edited, formatted, and posted last week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I resumed the AWCC soil fungi analysis.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_6">command line stuff</a> and <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_7">SLURM script</a>.</p>

<p>Examining <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:20">KNWR:Inv:20</a>, <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> from Seward. Clitellum on 32-37. This is <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>.</p>

<p><a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:33">KNWR:Inv:33</a>, from Rainbow Lake; <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:36">KNWR:Inv:36</a> (just entered), from Homer; <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7060">KNWR:Ento:7060</a>, from Canoe Lake; <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7206">KNWR:Ento:7206</a>, from Fish Lake; <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7096">KNWR:Ento:7096</a>, from Merganser Lake; and <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:8954">KNWR:Ento:8954</a>, from Cooper Landing are also <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>.  Now I have examined at least representative individuals from all localities from which I currently have specimens. All are <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>; none are <i>Lumbricus friendi</i>.</p>

<p>I submitted 100K more reads to be processed by <code>pipits_funits</code> on Yeti.  I also did some getting ready to process more, but I am waiting to receive results from yesterday's job before proceeding.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_8">command line script</a>, a <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_9">SLURM script</a>, and <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_10">an example</a> of a series of SLURM scripts submitted.</p>

<p>Examining worms brought to me from Homer. These look like <i>Dendrobaena octaedra</i>. Clitellum on 29-33. These are <i>D. octaedra</i>.</p>

<p>I circumnavigated the upland island east of Headquarters Lake, skiing around it in the wetlands.  It was splendid.  At I spring I collected a sample of bottom sand and muck.  In the lab I found some small crustaceans in this which look like Harpacticoida.</p>

<p>I entered data for that copepod from yesterday (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:37">KNWR:Inv:37</a>) and a <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> specimen which was not in Arctos for some reason (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7207">KNWR:Ento:7207</a>).</p>

<p>I resumed work on my Stormy Lake soil fungi article, making a map.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_11">R script</a>.</p>

<p>My AWCC soil fungi ITSx SLURM jobs finished just before lunch.  I ran the rest of the PIPITS steps.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_12">command line input</a> and the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_13">SLURM script</a>.  The results did not look good, with way too many Cercozoa reads.</p>

<p>I posted Biology News entries.</p>

<p>Now I really want to know what happened with that AWCC soil fungi analysis.  I was thinking about it last night. I did some looking at output on Yeti (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_14">notes/script</a>.) I might need to try <code>split_libraries.py</code> of QIIME (see Gweon et al., <a href="references.xhtml#Gweonetal2015">2015</a>).  Looking at the documentation, I think I need to use <code>split_libraries_fastq.py</code> (<a href="http://qiime.org/scripts/split_libraries_fastq.html">http://qiime.org/scripts/split_libraries_fastq.html</a>).</p>

<p>From <a href="http://qiime.org/tutorials/processing_illumina_data.html">http://qiime.org/tutorials/processing_illumina_data.html</a>:</p>

<quote>QIIME can be used to process single-end or paired-end read data from the Illumina platform. The primary script for merging paired-end read data in QIIME is join_paired_ends.py. See the script documentation for more details. This is typically applied as a pre-processing step before running split_libraries_fastq.py.</quote>

<p>I worked with QIIME for a while, but it seems the kind of input files I have from MrDNA are difficult to work with.</p>

<p>I downloaded quality-filtered, demultiplexed reads I had made earlier on Galaxy (#15) and used an <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_15">R script</a> to reformat them to what <code>pipits_funits</code> expects.</p>

<p>I ran another <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_16">SLURM script</a>.  We will see what happens.</p>

<p>I canceled the SLURM job begun at the end of the day yesterday.  It was still running, but it would take days.  I used an <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_17">R script</a> to format one fasta file per sample for <code>pipits_funits</code>.  I then wrote a series of SLURM scripts to process these data (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_18">example</a>).  I submitted the 12 jobs in parallel (see below).</p>

<p>I posted this week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I formatted a draft announcements article for the <i>AKES Newsletter</i>.</p>

<p>I posted three Biology News entries and added Dawn's new article to our literature database and to our on-line <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/bibliography.html">Publications Bibliography page</a>.</p>

<p>I started working on the skunk moth article for <i>AKES Newsletter</i>, but the author notified me that he is making some changes, so I will wait on this.</p>

<p>I formatted the meeting article for <i>AKES Newsletter</i> and posted presentations to akentsoc.org so that they can be linked to in this article.</p>

<p>I started on work using the <code>vegan</code> package to look at the Stormy Lake fungi data.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_19">R script</a>.</p>

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-02-15-1432_ef.png"/><p>PCA plot of Stormy Lake soil fungi data with <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> (Lt) as an environmental variable.</p></div>

<h2 id="toc_12">Monday, February 18</h2>

<p>I checked on Yeti on my AWCC analysis.  The ITSx step had failed because of an error in the re-inflation step.  I looked at the files and could not see what was wrong.  I may really need to somehow construct input files of the format PIPITS expects: separate R1 and R2 fasta files for each sample.</p>

<p>Might try Bayexer (<a href="https://github.com/HaisiYi/Bayexer">https://github.com/HaisiYi/Bayexer</a>).  I tried to use this, but I ran into problems.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_20">script</a>.</p>

<p>I came in late today due to family appointments in the morning.</p>

<p>Going back to Galaxy, tried splitting original R1 FASTQ file using Barcode splitter tool.  That worked, creating datasets 188 (data) and 189 (summary, below).</p>

<pre># Barcode	Count
AWCC1	42351
AWCC2	45738
AWCC3	46639
AWCC4	52856
AWCC5	33779
AWCC6	25379

CaribouHills2B	50063
CaribouHills3B	62257
CaribouHills4B	60989
unmatched	777148
total	1354187</pre>

<p>Need to trim barcodes off of these.  Should I trim the primer region also?  I did some looking and reading and found that yes, I should trim this off, so I will do so.  This should be trimming 8 bp for the barcode and 18 bp for the primer, so 26 bp. I did so using Trimmomatic on Galaxy (collection 203).</p>

<p>Todd invited me to go with him to investigate a congregation of eagles in Slikok Creek near the Sterling Highway and Arc Loop.  I could not turn this down.  Colin came also.</p>

<p>We looked in Slikok Creek off of Arc Loop Road and off of the Sterling Highway where eagles were congregating. At Arc Loop we saw a dipper working in the culvert (ebird checklist: <a href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S52946889">S52946889</a>).  We did see part of an old moose carcass, but most of the eagle activity was not centered around this.  We had wondered if there was a run of fish or something moving in the stream, but we saw none.  A few scoops with a net along vegetation yielded a sculpin and a nine-spined stickleback (iNaturalist observation: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20498842">20498842</a>), but that was all.  It appeared that this was just a big bird bath for eagles.  There were many eagles drying their wings and we did see one bird just standing in the water.</p>

<p>John had asked me lat in the day on Friday to write a <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article on worms, due tomorrow, so I need to get this done.  I did get started on it.</p>

<p>Regarding the AWCC fungi, do I need to trim anything off of the tails? I checked e-mail correspondence with Dr. Dowd at MrDNA lab.  We had planned on using the primers below.</p>

<pre>illITS3kyo2 GATGAAGAACGYAGYRAA
illITS4kyo3 CTBTTVCCKCTTCACTCG</pre>

<p><i>illITS3kyo2</i> is the forward primer.  The first two reads in the reverse FASTA file end in <code>CGAGTGAAGCGGCAACAG</code>. This looks like the reverse complement of <i>illITS4kyo3</i>, but I do not know how the degenerate (?) nucleotides <code>K</code>, <code>V</code>, and <code>Y</code> work. Anyway, I should trim this tail off.  I used FASTQ Trimmer on Galaxy to trim the last 18 bp from the original R2 file (dataset 218). 1354187 fastq reads were processed.</p>

<p>I continued writing the <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article finishing a draft in the afternoon and getting it to John.</p>

<p>I generated R2 fastq files using an <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_21">R script</a>. I uploaded these to Yeti.  My first <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_22">SLURM script</a> failed. <code>vsearch</code> gave the error</p>

<pre>Fatal error: Invalid line 3 in FASTQ file: '+' line must be empty or identical to header</pre>

<p>I thought that "+" was a normal line 3 for FASTQ format.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting yesterday's AWCC work.  I compared the R1 and R2 FASTQ files.  I found two problems with the R2 files generated by R.  First, the R2 file had the Windows carriage returns (CRLF) instead of UNIX (LF).  Second, all of the quality scores were changed to ";" so that all quality scores were lost.</p>

<p>I installed the <code>ShortRead</code> package and used an <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_23">R script</a> to make the R2 FASTQ files.  I transferred this to Yeti and then converted the newline characters to UNIX.</p>

<pre>dos2unix AWCC1_R2.fastq
...</pre>

<p>I re-ran that <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_22">SLURM script</a> from yesterday. For some reason the <code>pispino_createreadpairslist</code> worked but the <code>pispino_createreadpairslist</code> step did not. It worked over the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_24">command line</a>, though, yielding 339K reads.</p>

<p>I tried running the next steps of this analysis a couple of ways.</p>

<p>I entered data for Nicoletiidae specimens <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11302">KNWR:Ento:11302</a>-<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11304">KNWR:Ento:11304</a> and looked up a little literature on this group. I examined specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11302">KNWR:Ento:11302</a> (2 males and one female).  They look like illustrations of <i>Grassiella</i> as illustrated by Escherich (<a href="references.xhtml#Escherich1905">1905</a>) and not <i>Allograssiella</i> as described by Mendes and Schmid (<a href="references.xhtml#MendesSchmid2010">2010</a>).</p>

<p>That last <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_25">SLURM script</a> from yesterday was successful.</p>

<p>I tried to rerun the second script, but it failed very quickly.</p>

<p>I found the problem.  I had cut up that original prepped.fasta file wrongly, making the second file start with a read and not the label.  I fixed this problem and re-ran this.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_26">R script</a>, <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_27">shell script</a> for splitting the original fasta, example <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_28">SLURM script</a>, and <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_29">shell script</a> to run all of the SLURM scripts.</p>

<p>I formatted and posted this week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I edited and formatted the <i>Polix</i> article for the <i>AKES Newsletter</i>.</p>

<p>All of those SLURM jobs except the first one appeared to complete successfully.  I think with that first one I had neglected to remove the <code>out_funits_001</code> directory or something like that.  I restarted this.</p>

<p>That last SLURM <code>pipits_funits</code> jobbed appears to have run correctly.</p>

<p>I worked on coming up with a Refuge boundary map for the purposes of checklisting, removing all of the conveyed lands.</p>

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-02-25-1212_checklist_boundary.jpg"/><p>Simple Kenai National Wildlife Refuge boundaries map extracted for the purpose of checklisting.</p></div>

<p>I converted this to WKT format using <a href="https://mygeodata.cloud">https://mygeodata.cloud</a> with the intent of suppling this over the URL to GBIF for Refuge-specific searches, but this did not work. I think that the URL was much too long.  For the purpose of checklisting I will need to pull data off of GBIF just using the extent, then clip out the records from the Refuge.</p>

<p>Wow, the script I had started on Thursday running the whole thing through <code>pipits_funits</code> worked!  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_29">output</a>.  I started another <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_31">SLURM script</a> to run the <code>pipits_process</code> step.</p>

<p>I left work to take care of animals.  At home I found that that last <code>pipits_process</code> step had worked (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_31">output</a>). I then ran the <code>vsearch</code> step required by <code>LULU</code> via a <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_33">SLURM script</a>.</p>

<p>In the evening I ran <code>LULU</code>, used <code>FUNGuild</code>, and looked at the results.  See the <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_34">R script and other stuff</a>.</p>

<p>I made the small change requested for the <i>AKES Newsletter</i> skunk moth article.</p>

<p>I worked on the introduction of my <i>Lumbricus</i> soil fungi article for the <i>AKES Newsletter</i>.</p>

<p>I received an e-mail from Kyungsoo giving densities of up to over 30 g/m<sup>2</sup> of ash-free dry biomass of earthworms at Stormy Lake for the site closest to the boat launch. I wanted to convert these biomass numbers to something convenient for the typical newspaper reader.  Below is my back-of-the-envelope conversion.</p>

<p>Ash-free dry biomass of earthworms is roughly 15-22% of their live biomass (see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Earthworm_biomass_relation_between_fresh_mass_and_dry_mass">https://www.researchgate.net/post/Earthworm_biomass_relation_between_fresh_mass_and_dry_mass</a>), with 15-18% apparently accepted.  I went with 17%. 
Using this to convert middle of the range of values from closest to the boat launch of AFD 25 g/m2:</p>

<pre>## conversion factor from ash free dry biomass to fresh biomass is roughly

<p>I revised and submitted to John my <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I worked on my Stormy Lake soil fungi article, mostly on the introduction.</p>

<h2 id="toc_19">Wednesday, February 27</h2>

<p>I made some quick calculations based on data from Saltmarsh et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Saltmarshetal2016">2016</a>).</p>

<p>I filled out a project description for applying for an ADF&amp;G permit to collect blackfish this summer.</p>

<p>I worked on community analysis of Stormy Lake fungal data. I did some reading up on analysis types in McCune and Grace (<a href="references.xhtml#McCuneGrace2002">2002</a>). p. 102:
It looks like either direct gradient analysis, where we know what the explanatory variables of interest are, or indirect gradient analysis, where we don't know ahead of time, would be appropriate.  In my case I do know what my variable of interest is.  CCA and canonical correlation are indirect gradient analysis methods.

p. 109: 
Vector fitting would be ok for what I am trying to do.

p. 115:
PCA would not be appropriate for my data, which are not linear or normal.  At least I do not want to worry about these assumptions.

p. 125:
NMS would be appropriate, apparently the best.

p. 154:
Should not use CA.

p. 160:
Should not use DCA.

p. 164:
CCA would be ok with cautions.</p>

<p>I still am unsure whether vector fitting or constrained methods would be best.  In the end I did both.  I found that I had insufficient data (not enough sites?) to use NMS, but CCA seemed to work.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_38">R script</a> and a second <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_39">R script</a>, in the end making plots that were colorful if nothing else.</p>

<p>Biplot of OTUs (circles) and sampling sites (labeled boxes) from a correspondence analysis where presence of <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> was included as an environmental variable. Colors of OTU circles correspond to category colors from the pie charts I made on <a href="#toc_1">February 1</a>.  Red and blue lines indicate groupings of sites by earthworm presence.</p></div>

<p>Biplot of OTUs and sampling sites from a constrained correspondence analysis where presence of <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> was included as a constraint. See explanation in the caption of the figure above.</p></div>

<p>I also made a new set of pie charts for the article. See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_40">R script</a>.</p>

<p>I worked on the Stormy Lake fungi article, incorporating these figures.</p>
