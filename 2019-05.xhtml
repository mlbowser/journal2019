<p>I worked on going through and replying to correspondence.</p>  

<p>I signed up or A325R training and started taking A100 aviation training.</p>      

<p>I ended up spending much of the afternoon working on earthworm records in a list of non-native species known from Alaska.</p>

<p>I spent the morning on editing the list of non-native species known from Alaska, but much remained to be done.</p>

<p>I dug up coordinates from spruce sampling in 2015 for Diana Wolf, who is working with these samples.</p>

<p>I worked a little on tidying 2017 EDRR data and worked on the manuscript a bit.</p>

<p>I cleaned out my work truck.  At the gas station I made sure the new fuel card worked, then I washed the truck at the car wash.</p>

<p>Visited birch <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:11555">KNWR:Herb:11555</a> at Headquarters looking for male catkins, but there were none.</p>

<p>Birch <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:11556">KNWR:Herb:11556</a> had male catkins within reach. I collected some.</p>

<p>I made a GenBank Bioproject (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/542936">PRJNA542936</a>) for the 2017 EDRR samples, formatted sample data, and made BioSample submissions.</p>

<p>I collected male catkins from birch <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:11554">KNWR:Herb:11554</a> at my house this morning.  These were actively shedding pollen.</p>

<p>I worked making 2017 EDRR submission to GenBank BioSample (accessions SAMN11647544-SAMN11647576) and GenBank SRA.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_75">R script</a>.</p>

<p>Cullen and I readied equipment for elodea sampling later today.</p>

<p>I worked on preparing EDRR STDP data to be uploaded to Arctos.</p>

<p>John, Cullen, and I took the Magnum out to Sport Lake, where we completed the 50 point shoreline survey for elodea and we collected water samples for fluridone concentrations monitoring.  We found no elodea.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Friday, May 17</h2>

<p>In the morning I finished submitting STDP records to Arctos. See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_76">R script from yesterday and today</a>.</p>

<p>John, Cullen, Maura, and I took two canoes out to the North South Lakes today, where John and Maura plugged the hole in the outlet beaver dam with plastic mesh and collected water samples for fluridone concentrations monitoring.  We split up the 50 point elodea survey between both teams.  Out of 100 rake throws we found only a single strand of brittle, brown, dying elodea.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Monday, May 20</h2>

<p>I arrived early and drove the FasTEST water samples to Kenai to be sent of to SePRO SRTC (FedEx tracking #: 813677694720).</p>

<p>I reviewed an FWSpecies checklist of biota of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.</p>

<p>The afternoon I spent at the annual seasonal safety training, where I gave a presentation on dangerous plants.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Tuesday, May 21</h2>
<p>With Debbie's help I sent a FedEx label to Hugh to get birch specimens returned.</p>

I will work on sample frame plans.  We will plan for 60 sites, a stratified sample of 6 coarse cover types / bins with approximately 10 sites per class/bin.  Where possible we will revisit the sites sampled extensively for bryophytes and lichens in 2008.</p>

	preventing injury
		helmet
		secure cargo
		crash position
		seat belts
	knowing your way out of the aircraft - how do you get there blindfolded?
	ability to hold breath long enough
	enduring environmental conditions - have survival stuff on your person.

What are you doing to increase safety before you fly?
	hazard analysis / plan to mitigation
	training
	pilot briefing / aircraft safety briefing
	flight following in place
	making sure we have the right PPE
	have basic survival gear on yourself, including, e.g.
		personal locator beacon
		matches
		space blanket
		knife
		food

Definitions		
	Extended over water = 50 nautical miles beyond shore
	Operations beyond gliding distance - a DOI definition = beyond the point at which an aircraft can safely glide to shore.

PFD
	Comply with ALSE handbook
	Must be manually inflated (must not be water activated)
	Must have two ways to inflated
	Must be inspected every year or every 18 months

When must PFDs be available or worn?
	When operating beyond gliding distance from shore
		any helo - must wear vest
		single-engine aircraft - must wear vest
		multi-engine aircraft - must be available

Exposure suits - for extended over water
	wear in single-engine aircraft
	available in multi-engine aircraft
	
Must have life raft for extended over water (beyond 50 miles from shore)

Aircraft, single-engine must have floats for extended over water.

Flight helmets - OPM-29, special use activities for manned aircraft

What is training policy for overwater?
	A312/A325R every two years
	
Prior to flight - Pilot to passenger briefing
	door operation / egress route
	camping kit / survival kit

What should the briefing always include? (use orange five steps to a safe flight card)
	ELT button / operation
	fuel switch
	electric switch
	fire extinguisher
	egress
	location of survival gear
	where is the raft / survival suits (if these are on board)
	seat belt operation

Egress can be affected by
	other passengers
	cargo blocking exits
	door locks
	flaps on a 206
	secondary restraints

Cargo
	weighed and manifested
	stowed according to pilot's direction
	properly secured
	
6 steps to egress
	1. I'm a survivor.
	2. unplug helmet / headset
	3. open door &amp; brace
	4. wait 4 for motion to stop and sit upon
	5. clear exit and find reference point
	6. unbuckle and exit
	
Barriers to egress
	inverted aircraft
	on-rushing water
	entanglement
	obstructions
	darkness
	panic / other poeple
	
If you can, best to swim out, away from the aircraft, then up. Hand up, head up to investigate.

Hypothermia
	head out of water
	HELP position
	carpet
	huddle
	
Signal devices
	PLD / sat phone / cell phone
	bigger - brighter - different, to be seen

Rafts
	identify who will deploy

I shot 5/5 on the first set and 4/5 on the second.</p>

<p>I realized that in the LTEMP sample frame work I did earlier the Funny River Fire was missing from the fire dataset that I had used.</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">Thursday, May 23</h2>
<p>Before work I collected male catkins from birches that I had sampled previously along K Beach Road.  Notes taken on my phone are included below.</p>

<pre>https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/9302456
This Birch had no male catkins available.

https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/9305643
There were a few catkins available on this birch, which I collected.

https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/9357575
I had to climb this one, but I was able to get male catkins.

https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6821393
There were very few male catkins anywhere on this tree, but I did collect a few.

https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7421409
I was able to climb and get male catkins from this birch.</pre>

<p>I worked on replacing all of the occurrence data from the STDP project with records that included collecting methods and relationships (See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_79">R script</a>).  I need to check the sequence / identification of <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAMObs:Ento:238482">UAMObs:Ento:238482</a>, identified as <i>Spilogona sororcula</i>.  It may be a <i>Phaonia</i>.</p>

<p>I took a walk down to Headquarters Lake wetland with Dawn and Heidi to familiarize Heidi with the flora.</p>

<p>Field notes (from ipad):</p>

<pre>2019-05-23

Dawn, Heidi, and I walked down to Headquarters Lake so that Heidi could work on her plant ID and I could collect Betula male catkins.

I did locate the Betula nana I had sampled previously, but it lacked catkins. I collected male catkins from a nearby individual.</pre>

<p>I took the chainsaw refresher course in the later afternoon, taught by Mike Hill.</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">Monday, May 28</h2>

<p>I arrived early this morning at 5:45 because I will need to leave early.  I was disappointed to learn from an e-mail from Rob Massengill today that northern pike were found in the Vogel Lake system.  Todd also told me that the minnows in Kenai survived.</p>

<p>I added reciprocal relationships to STDP records on Arctos (see <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_1">R script</a>).</p>

<p>I attended the biology staff meeting at 8:15 this morning.</p>
<p>Later in the morning I walked with our seasonal staff Caterina, Cullen, Frannie, Rachel, and Heidi, teaching them how to recognize our common trees and large shrubs for the purpose of the vegetation classification error estimation that we will be doing this summer.</p>
<p>This afternoon I attended the training by Melinda Lamb and Betty Charnon where they showed us the Survey123 form and methods we will be using this summer for the error estimation.</p>

<p>I started taking the A100 aviation safety class (see notes below).</p>

<pre>A100 notes

Mission Preparation and Planning 1

Tools
	Five steps to a safe flight
	Twelve standard aviation questions that shout "Watch Out!"

Mishap Prevention Plans
	= Aviation plans?
	
Plans:
 National
  Regional
   Unit
    Project

Plans must be reviewed and updated annually.

Two types of missions:
	point-to-point = from airport to airport
	special use = everything else

What is the right tool? airplane v. helo?

Mission Preparation and Planning 2

Flight routes / areas
	-obstructions
	-airports
	-special hazards, e.g., gliders, skydiving
	-what kind of airspace? uncontrolled or lots of traffic? military operating areas? Are there congested areas on the surface?
	
Risk assessment is required.
	A tool to measure risk.

Flight hazard map
	-must be specific to our areas
	-required
	-more detailed than sectional maps

Mission objectives
	-are the obtainable, realistic?
	-what does success look like?
	-how to do we measure success?
	-What is the appropriate level of approval?

Cost
	-Do we have authority to spend money on air operations?
	-Is there an alternative?
	-Justifiable (red face test)
	-hidden costs? e.g., mobilization cost, ferry fee

Project Aviation Safety Plan
	-to provide an organized method to manage risk and document how we are going to mitigate risk
	-description of project
	-list participants
	-approvals
	-risk assessment
	-required for special use

Approvals
	-communicate risk
	-when in doubt, ask!
	
Mission Preparation and Planning 3

PPE requirements
	-ALSE (Aviation Life Support Equipment) handbook

Special use requires 4 elements
	-flight helmet
	-leather/nomex gloves
	-nomex clothing, long sleeved
	-leather boots

Flight Helmets

Mission Preparation and Planning 4

Anti-exposure suits
	-must be worn extended over water over water &lt;= 50 degrees
	-must be available in multi-engine aircraft over water &lt;= 50 degrees

PFD
	-worn beyond gliding distance to shore
	-must be available in multi-engine aircraft over water
	-must be worn in water take-off/landing
	
Flight following is required
	-written or
	-radio contact or
	-AFF (automated flight following)
	
Will you be prepared to survive?
	-consider worst case scenario
	-have survival gear on your person.

	-shelter
	-weather
	-temperature
	-signalling
	-water/method of collecting water
	-fire
	-communication
	-ditching
	
	-fire starter
	-laser rescue light
	-signal mirror
	-knife or multitool
	-water purification tablets
	-clear plastic bags
	-beacons/trackers</pre>
	
<p>John asked me to survey one of the Nikiski Lakes for elodea, so Caterina, Rachel and I drove out to Stormy Lake and performed the 50-point elodea survey there.  We found no elodea.</p>

<h2 id="toc_13">Thursday, May 30</h2>
<p>John and I spoke with Diana Wolf today about spruce genetics from specimens collected in 2015. Notes:</p>

<div class="nb"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-05-30_nb_02.jpg"/></div>

<p>John asked me to prepare generate histograms of the percentages of each species represented in indiduals, so I did so.  See <a href="appendices_April-June.xhtml#toc_2">R script</a>.</p>

<p>I completed my A100 aviation training in the afternoon. Notes:</p>

<pre>Mission Preparation and Planning 5

Aircraft procurement

types of contracts
	-exclusive use
	-call when needed
	-aircraft rental agreement
	-end product
	-on call
	-cooperator aircraft (e.g., state, military, other federal agency, academic institution, public utility, foreign governments)
	-fleet aircraft
	
Mission Preparation and Planning 6

Goal of planning is to reduce risk.  This is everyone's responsibility. Planning also makes the mission go more smoothly.

Risk management fundamentals
	1. accept no unnecessary risk
	2. the higher the risk, the higher of approval required
	3. only accept risk when benefit outweighs the cost

Risk management process
e.g., a 5-step process
	1. Identify hazards
	2. Assess hazards (How likely are hazards? How severe are they?)
	3. Mitigation (i.e., controls), e.g. flight helmets
	4. Implement
	5. Evaluate (review)
	
Methods to assess risk - there are multiple methods.

Mission Preparation and Planning 7

e.g., Risk assessment worksheet

Mission Preparation and Planning 8
GAR model (green amber red model worksheet)

ACS Rescue Mission Gone Wrong

Mission Preparation and Planning 9

Mishap response plan
	-required to be completed, updated, reviewed
	
priorities
	1. preserve life
	2. protect property
	3. preserve evidence
	4. notify and investigate

mishap reporting
report immediately
	-any event that causes any damage or injurty
	-etc.
	
Pilot and Aircraft 1

Carding
	pilot
	aircraft
	etc.

Briefings 1 
	-mission briefing
	-aircraft briefing
	
Mission briefing
	
&gt;10K feet may need O2.

Operational Safety 1 
	-crew resource management
