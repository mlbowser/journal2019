<h1>December</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">Wednesday, December 4</h2>

<p>John had written us with instructions for the coming field season.
 </p><ul>
  <li>We will need to be measuring Composite Burn Index (CBI) within the Swan Lake Fire with a special focus on the response of tundra and <i>Calamagrostis</i> to this fire.</li>
  <li>We will need to treat Sandpiper Lake.</li>
 </ul>
<p></p>


<p>Maura Schumacher had asked about bird cherries in Kasilof. I responded:</p>

<blockquote>Dear Maura,

In that Kasilof beach population there are a number of individuals (maybe 10 or more?), some of them large and reproducing.  There is no standing water, but there is a little seep-fed stream.  I do not think the stream plays much of a role in dispersal at this site; I think dispersal here is mainly by birds. This is in on Borough land, but it is under a lease and you will need to contact the lessee.  I think the lessee had previously granted permission for the bird cherries to be treated, but then nothing was done.  The source of this population is likely a couple of large bird cherry trees on private land above the wetland.

Also, see the observation records at the URI below.

<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=60.84462282891534&amp;nelng=-148.58626158007814&amp;place_id=any&amp;swlat=60.100162353960734&amp;swlng=-151.7310980058594&amp;taxon_id=143793">https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=60.84462282891534&amp;nelng=-148.58626158007814&amp;place_id=any&amp;swlat=60.100162353960734&amp;swlng=-151.7310980058594&amp;taxon_id=143793</a>

The record at Gwin's Lodge would be worth checking out (URI below) to determine whether or not these are escaping. The worst place to have birch cherries on the Kenai Peninsula would be upstream on any of long streams/rivers.  We would not want bird cherries getting into the Kenai River in Cooper Landing.

Also, I saw small feral bird cherries in a vacant lot off of Lovers Lane in Soldotna near 60.478508°N, 151.075664°W.

<p>We received our assembly for birch specimen MBBP01 (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:11556">KNWR:Herb:11556</a>), but apparently it was not a good assembly because Eric at SNPSaurus stated that, "this is as good an assembly I could get from it."  I downloaded the file for perusal later.</p>
    
<p>I worked some on the Slikok dataset, looking at community data (<a href="appendices_October-December.xhtml#toc_20">R script</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Thursday, December 5</h2>

<p>I worked on moving some species from our old checklist onto FWSpecies.</p>

<p>I spent most of the middle of the day working on the Slikok manuscript.</p>

<p>I attended the quarterly Kenai Peninsula CWMA meeting in the afternoon to represent the Refgue there.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Friday, December 6</h2>

<p>David Bloom has been helping me to get all KNWR data on Arctos to be published to GBIF via <a href="http://ipt.vertnet.org/">VertNet's IPT</a>.</p>

<p>Initial description of the KNWRObs:Bird collection:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge has been conducting avian surveys since 1957, when aerial surveys for trumpeter swans were initiated. Since that time various projects by Kenai National Wildlife Refuge staff have included or focused on bird observations including audio/visual observations and automated sound recordings. The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Bird observations dataset includes more than 500 bird observations from the Kenai Peninsula.</blockquote>

<p>Geographic coverage:
 </p><ul>
  <li>west: -152.073</li>
  <li>east: -147.854</li>
  <li>south: 59.097</li>
  <li>north: 61.08</li>
 </ul>
<p></p>

<p>I formatted and posted last week's and this week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> articles.</p>

<p>Reading up on ordination/classification methods (see <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2018/05/04/ordination.html">https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2018/05/04/ordination.html</a> and vegan vegdist function documentation), it looks like the Jaccard or Raup-Crick indices would be more appropriate for presence/absence data.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/21/data-clustering.html#Distance">https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/21/data-clustering.html#Distance</a>:</p>

<blockquote>When working with large presence/absence datasets, it is good practice to remove “uniques”. “Uniques” are species that only have one recorded presence in only one observation/sample. The reason behind this is that such species will only bring noise (somewhat random, hard to explain variation) to the analysis and will only blur the patterns we get. Later on, for the sake of practice, we’ll compare the results we’ll get with the full presence and absence matrix with the results we’ll get with the same matrix without any “Uniques”.</blockquote>


<p>I will try removing uniques.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Saturday, December 7</h2>

<p>David had set up the other KNWR collections on the VertNet IPT, so I edited metatdata.  For the KNWR:Inv collection:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's invertebrate collection includes terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates (except for arthropods), mostly earthworms from the Kenai Peninsula.</blockquote>

<p>KNWR herbarium:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's herbarium includes  over 2,000 plant and fungi specimens, mostly from the Kenai Peninsula, dating from the 1950s to present.</blockquote>

<p>KNWRObs:Mamm:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's mammal observations dataset publishes observations and historical records of mammals on the Kenai Peninsula.</blockquote>

<p>KNWRObs:Fish:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's fish observations dataset publishes observations and historical records of fish from the Kenai Peninsula.</blockquote>

<p>KNWR:Ento:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's entomology collection includes over 8,000 terrestrial arthropod specimens, mostly from the Kenai Peninsula.</blockquote>

<p>KNWRObs:Herb:</p>

<blockquote>The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge has been conducting vegetation surveys since 1950. The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's plant observation dataset includes observations and historical records of plants and fungi from the Kenai Peninsula.</blockquote>

<h2 id="toc_5">Monday, December 9</h2>

<p>I worked at home in the morning on reclustering the Slikok community data.</p>

<p>I was all loaded up in my warmed-up car when I called the office to check if the power was out. There was apparently no power there, so I am working at home.  It is windy outside and the lights have been flickering on and off at home. I worked at home, calling in hourly.</p>

<p>Power was restored later, so I drove to work.</p>

<p>All of the Kenai NWR Arctos data are now on GBIF (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/publisher/3492d3bb-0ca5-4605-851a-82e4edbc6acd">https://www.gbif.org/publisher/3492d3bb-0ca5-4605-851a-82e4edbc6acd</a>).</p>

<p>I left off breaking the Slikok communities into five community clusters (<a href="appendices_October-December.xhtml#toc_21">R script</a>).</p>

<p>I worked on the Slikok manuscript (<a href="appendices_October-December.xhtml#toc_23">R script</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Thursday, December 21</h2>

<p>I worked on the Slikok manuscript.</p>

<p>I received worm specimens from Tyler that he and Adrian had collected at Pilgrim Hot Springs this last summer.</p>

<p>Examining worms from Pilgrim Hots Spring, sample 1-1-1. This immature worm looks like it has some pigment. Very closely paired setae. Prostomium epilobic. Could be lots of species, but I will not get anywhere with these immatures. I selected one individual, photographed it, removed ~1 cm from its caudal end, and placed this is LifeScanner vial BOLD-4M9.</p>

<p>Sample 1-2-1 looks the same. I picked an individual, photographed it, and placed a tissue sample in LifeScanner vial BOLD-2Z1.</p>

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-12-12_worm_1-1-1.jpg"/><p>Immature earthworm from Pilgrim Hot Springs.</p></div>

<p>I packaged all 30 LifeScanner specimens that I have accumulated and placed them in the mail box to be shipped by USPS (tracking #: LZ989696187US).</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Friday, December 13</h2>

<p>I spent most of the day working on the Slikok manuscript, finally getting a draft out for review.</p>

<p>I took a walk out into Headquarters Lake wetland in the afternoon. Arthropods were out and about on the ice (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/mbowser/2019/12/13">https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/mbowser/2019/12/13</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">Monday, December 16</h2>

<p>I made revisions to the Slikok manuscript.</p>

<p>We received from RTL Genomics the bacterial metabarcoding data from the 2019 black spruce project. I downloaded these and will scrutinize them later.</p>

<p>I participated in a teleconference regarding FIA sampling this summer.</p>

<p>I added a <code>flag_spp_intern</code> function to <a href="https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies">KenaiNWRspecies</a> to recognize species in FWSpecies output. I also made some updates to the data.</p>

<p>I took a walk around Headquarters Lake in the afternoon (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/mbowser/2019/12/16">https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/mbowser/2019/12/16</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">Tuesday, December 17</h2>

<p>Derek had provided many comments on the Slikok manuscript, so I worked on addressing these (<a href="appendices_October-December.xhtml#toc_25">R script</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Wednesday, December 18</h2>

<p>I was working on the Slikok manuscript, but there appear to be problems with the ARPHA writing tool right now.</p>

<p>I sorted sweep net samples <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11346">KNWR:Ento:11346</a>, <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11347">KNWR:Ento:11347</a>, <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11348">KNWR:Ento:11348</a>, , <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11349">KNWR:Ento:11349</a>. That makes 14 sweep net samples processed so far, better than half way done.</p>

<p>This afternoon a new and improved report became available through FWSpecies. I made some updates to <a href="https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies">KenaiNWRspecies</a> to take advantage of this.</p>

<h2 id="toc_13">Thursday, December 19</h2>

<p>I worked on the Slikok manuscript some, but then the online ARPHA/Pensoft writing interface kept giving me connectivity errors. This is one reason I would like to get away from using ARPHA/Pensoft for writing manuscripts.</p>

<h2 id="toc_14">Friday, December 20</h2>

<p>I spent most of the day on the Slikok manuscript, finally getting a draft out for review to the authors with the intent of submitting it for review and publication soon.</p>

<h2 id="toc_15">Monday, December 23</h2>

<p>I worked on reviewing an revising the Slikok manuscript.</p>

<p>New fields had been added to the FWSpecies output report, so I updated <a href="https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies">KenaiNWRspecies</a>.</p>

<p>Arctos is down as of this morning.</p>

<p>I edited this week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article, getting it sent to the <i>Clarion</i>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_16">Thursday, December 26</h2>

<div class="todo">
