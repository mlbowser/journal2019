<p>I formatted and posted <a href="https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Region_7/NWRS/Zone_2/Kenai/Sections/What_We_Do/In_The_Community/Refuge_Notebooks/2019_Articles/Refuge_Notebook_v21_n05.pdf">today's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article</a>.</p>

<p>I worked on the Stormy Lake earthworm soil fungi article.</p>

<p>I just learned that there is a newer UNITE release (8.0).  I should have used that.  Oh, well, I am not starting over on the Stormy Lake fungal analysis at this point.</p>

<p>I worked on graphs (<a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_41">R script</a>) and on examining some of the mycorrhizal OTUs (<a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_42">R script and notes</a>).</p>

<p>Hours: 06:45-07:30, 10:00-12:00, 20:30-22:30</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Sunday, March 3</h2>

<p>I worked on trying to finish up the Stormy Lake earthworm soil fungi article.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Monday, March 4</h2>

<div class="todo">To do:
<ul>

<li>Finish Stormy Lake fungi article.  See about uploading data to GenBank SRA, Zenodo, and/or PlutoF.</li>
<li>Post AKES meeting presentations.</li>
</ul>
</div>                                                                                                      

<p>I made BioProject, BioSample, and read submissions to NCBI GenBank SRA for the Stormy Lake soil fungi data. → BioProject <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/525443">PRJNA525443</a></p>

<p>I started learning how to work with projects and samples in <a href="https://plutof.ut.ee/">PlutoF</a>, getting a project set up (<a href="https://plutof.ut.ee/#/study/view/74051">https://plutof.ut.ee/#/study/view/74051</a>), but I did not get to the point of uploading sequences.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out the best way to get HTS occurrence data to GBIF.  It appears that NCBI GenBank reads/occurrences do not get harvested by or linked to GBIF in a regular way.  I know that PlutF/UNITE reads can be harvested by GBIF.  I did some tinkering and testing and got one test sequence uploaded via the importer.  It will take a little bit of work to get the names formatted correctly.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Tuesday, March 5</h2>

<p>Those GenBank SRA submissions were published and are now available at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA525443">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA525443</a>.</p>

<p>I worked on reformatting OTU sequence data to upload to PlutoF.  This ended up being a more difficult task than I had expected (see <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_43">R script</a>).</p>

<p>I worked on the Stormy Lake fungi article, making a small change to the map (<a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_44">R script</a>).  I sent off a draft requesting for reviews.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Wednesday, March 6</h2>

<p>Those PlutoF imports are still hung up, waiting to be processed.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="http://www.akentsoc.org/archives/1474">presentations from the AKES annual meeting</a>.</p>

<p>I entered data for <i>Dendrobaena octadra</i> specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:38">KNWR:Inv:38</a> and added this to the collection.</p>

<p>I started work on an Alaska blackfish diet article for the <i>AKES Newsletter</i>.</p>

<p>After some tweaking I got the first 60 records imported into PlutoF.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_45">R script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Thursday, March 7</h2>

<p>I continued importing Stormy Lake sequence data to PlutoF, getting this done! (See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_46">R script</a>)</p>

<p>Colin and I drove out to Kenai to look for Alaska blackfish in the vicinity of the pond of of Candlelight Dr. where I had seen them earlier and in the stream behind Walmart.  We did find open water in a few places, mainly at seeps, but we saw no blackfish.</p>

<p>I worked on entering data from blackfish gut contents specimens into Arctos in preparation for a short article on blackfish diet.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Friday, March 8</h2>

<p>I started out responding to an e-mail inquiry about earthworms, finding out about the new Yukon record of <i>Arctiostrotus fontinalis</i>, and looking up and requesting pertinent literature.</p>

<p>I formatted and posted this week's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I commented on a record of cutthroat trout from Woodpecker Lake on the Refuge (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Fish:328">UAM:Fish:328</a>).  This seems to me to be a questionable record.</p>

<p>Another interesting record was for <i>Coregonus laurettae</i>, Bering cisco, at Gene Lake (<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Fish:2444">UAM:Fish:2444</a>)  We do not have this species on our checklist.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Sunday, March 10</h2>

<p>I worked on formatting a table of blackfish prey items.</p>

<p>I finished a draft of the blackfish diet article.</p>

<p>I started an article on the 2017 STDP metagenomic work in the journal <a href="https://riojournal.com/"><i>Research Ideas and Outcomes</i></a>.  I uploaded all 64 raw FASTQ files to Yeti.  I intend to begin an analysis using QIIME 2™.  I wrote a manifest file using an <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_47">R script</a>.</p>

<p>I attended the safety meeting at 09:00. Action points:</p>

<ul>
<li>MOCC refresher - I should take this this year.</li>
<li>New PPE policy - Record keeping required PPE training. Refuge is responsible for providing PPE.</li>
<li>JHAs - Need to check bio JHAs. These should be done before April 5. Definitely need JHA for spraying.</li>
<li>Aviation. Will need to have all helmets inspected. Will likely need to destroy some helmets.</li>
<li>Need to update lab safety plan.</li>

<p>I looked at methods of reference library creation of Nilsson et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Nilssonetal2018">2018</a>), Richardson et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Richardsonetal2018">2018</a>), and Pruesse et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Pruesseetal2007">2007</a>). The work of Richardson et al. (<a href="references.xhtml#Richardsonetal2018">2018</a>) is most similar to what I need to do, but I think it would not be easy for me to set up Metaxa2.  I need to figure out how to make a library that QIIME 2 can use for now, not necessarily a library as well-curated as these major databases.</p>

<p>I started downloading records from BOLD, which was taking a long time.</p>

<p>While downloading I worked on assembling all of the submitted articles for the <i>AKES Newsletter</i> into an issue.</p>

<p>I got started on building a library.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_49">notes and, scripts, I/O</a>.</p>

<p>I did some editing of the <i>AKES Newsletter</i> draft and sent it out to the editorial committee, authors, and others for review.</p>

<p>I saw that BOLD's BIN algorithm was run this weekend.</p>

<p>I resumed work on construction of an Alaska DNA barcode library for HTS.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_50">notes and I/O</a>.</p>

<p>I posted two Biology News entries requested by John.</p>

<p>I posted today's <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article.</p>

<p>I worked more on the library, re-running the dereplication and clustering steps.  I started selecting best library records, also. See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_53">I/O</a>, <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_54">R script</a>, and <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_55">SLURM script</a>.</p>

<p>I took a short walk in the middle of the day.  There were caterpillars, spiders, and moths out and about on the snow in the wetland.</p>

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-03-22_Erebidae.jpg"/><p>Caterpillar (I think <i>Phragmatobia fuliginosa</i>) out on the wetland south of Headquarters lake (iNaturalist observation: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21494296">21494296</a>).</p></div>

<p>I worked on editing the <i>AKES Newsletter</i> based on comments I had received.</p>

<h2 id="toc_18">Monday, March 25</h2>

<p>I entered data for and examined series <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11316">KNWR:Ento:11316</a>, a series of stoneflies from the Kasilof River that I had collected on Thursday.  I obtained Nebeker and Gaufin (<a href="references.xhtml#NebekerGaufin1965">1965</a>, <a href="references.xhtml#NebekerGaufin1967">1967</a>) and compared my specimens to these illustrations.  My specimens are <i>Utacapnia columbiana</i> (Claassen, 1924), the same species I had previously collected from the Soldotna area.  Nebeker and Gaufin (<a href="references.xhtml#NebekerGaufin1965">1965</a>) listed a specimen record from Deep Creek taken in 1956.</p>

<p>There are currently no sequences of Utacapnia combiana from Alaska on BOLD, so I put one male in lifescanner vial BOLD-P00 → <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11317">KNWR:Ento:11317</a>.</p>

<div class="figure"><img alt="Image" src="img/2019-03-25_KNWR-Ento-11317.jpg"/><p>Specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11317">KNWR:Ento:11317</a>, habitus.</p></div>

<p>Specimen <a href="http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:8873">KNWR:Ento:8873</a> is also <i>Utacapnia columbiana</i>.</p>

<p>I cloned these records into the UAM:Ento collection so that I can donate them to UAM.  I am trying to downsize our collection.</p>

<p>Regarding <i>Utacapnia</i>, I was surprised that, according to Stewart (<a href="references.xhtml#StewartRicker1997">1997</a>), "there have been no published accounts of biology of any species in this
genus."  I wonder if that has changed.</p>

<p>I worked more on library prep for the STDP analysis.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_60">I/O</a> and <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_61">SLURM script</a>.</p>

<p>I applied final edits to the <i>AKES Newsletter</i> and started uploading files.  I was stopped at the Arctos publication / doi steps when Arctos apparently went down. Later Arctos was back up, so I got the <i>Newsletter</i> articles posted.</p>

<p>I walked across Ski Hill Road into the woods some distance away from the road and set out two pan traps under a white spruce in mixed spruce-birch forest. One was baited with white vinegar mixed with water; the other contained a mixture of water, molasses, and bread yeast. It is a cool, overcast day, so I do not expect these to attract much.</p>

<p>I worked on the STDP analysis, assigning taxonomy using BOLD and running LULU. See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_65">R script</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_21">Thursday, March 28</h2>

<p>I worked at home a little in the morning, updating the Biology News page on our website.</p>

<p>I continued with the STDP analysis, looking at assigned taxonomy.  See <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_66">R script</a>, another <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_67">R script</a> assembling the identifications, and <a href="appendices_January-March.xhtml#toc_68">tree making I/O</a> using QIIME and iTOL.</p>

<p>I checked the pan traps I had put out yesterday.  All they had collected was one large fly in the dish baited with vinegar and one immature delphacid in the dish baited with molasses and yeast.  I collected the fly and let the live delphacid go.  I did not end up retaining the fly specimen.</p>

<p>Looking through our identifications, it looks like <i>Hydrophoria lancifer</i>, an exotic species, is new to Alaska.  Searches of Arctos and GBIF turned up no Alaska Records.  Griffiths (<a href="references.xhtml#Griffiths1998">1998</a>) also did not list this species from Alaska.  I checked the sequence against BOLD.  It appeared to be solid.</p>

<p>I see I still need to do some filtering based on selecting just Animalia (from phylogenetic tree) and records that have more than 0 reads after the filtering I did earlier today.</p>

<div class="todo">To do:
<ul>
<li>STDP analysis.</li>

<p>I did some literature searches on biogegraphy and ecology of <i>Hydrophoria lancifer</i>.</p>

<p>I rechecked those vinegar and molasses pan traps.  They had caught just three flies.</p>

<p>I drove down to Soldotna Creek Park to take pictures of stoneflies for a <i>Refuge Notebook</i> article I was asked to write.  There were plenty of stoneflies emerging.</p>
